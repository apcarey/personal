        <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
        <p> I will be a senior next year because I skipped my junior year of high school. I will also be a freshamn in college at Harold Washington College as I finish my last year of high school. After I graduate I plan on transferring to a universirty, but I'm not sure which one yet. My majors in college will be law and business and my minors will be technology and accounting.</p>
